This is a visualisation of the Hopf Fibration (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_fibration).
For a set of points on the surface of the 2-sphere which lie on a plane parallel to its equator, each ring shown
is a stereographic projection of the fiber (a great circle on the 3-sphere) mapped to that point.
The points on the 2-sphere are revolving around the vertical axis whilst travelling up and down between the poles;
this produces the expansion and rotation of the projected fibers, revealing some of the fibration's structure...
